<h3>Sentinel-1 Enhanced Spectral Diversity<br>
</h3>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span>This operator follows the Backgeocoding
operator in the TOPS InSAR processing chain. It first estimates a
constant range offset for the whole sub-swath of the split S-1 SLC
image using incoherent cross-correlation. The estimation is done for
each burst using a small block of data in the center of the burst. The
estimates from all bursts are then averaged to get the final constant
range offset for the whole image.<br>
</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span>The operator then estimates a constant
azimuth offset for the whole sub-swath using a Enhanced Spectral
Diversity (ESD) method. The ESD
approach exploits the data at the overlapped area of the adjacent
bursts. The estimation is done for a number of windows in every overlapped area and the final
azimuth offset is obtained by averaging all the estimations. <br>
</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span>The estimated range and azimuth shifts are
saved in the metadata of the output product. The ESD estimations for
all windows and all overlaps are saved in and ASCII file with master
and slave acquisition dates and "_azimuth_shift" in the file name. The
file can be found at user's \.snap\var\log folder. <br>
</span>
</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span>Finally, the operator performs range and
azimuth corrections for every burst using the range and azimuth offsets
estimated above with a phase
ramp method in frequency domain</span>.</p><p class="MsoNormal">When
using ESD estimations read from ASCII files that were saved previously,
an average is taken of all the estimates from the subswaths selected by
the user. E.g., if the user selects IW1 and IW3, then one average is
taken of the estimates from both IW1 and IW3.

<h4>Input <br>
</h4>



<ul>
<li>The input to this operator is the resulting product from the
Backgeocoding operator. It is the co-registered master and slave images
for the same
sub-swath and same polarization (e.g. IW1 -
VV). <br>
  </li>
</ul>

<h4>Output <br>
</h4>




<ul>
<li>The output of the operator are the co-registered master and slave
bands in I/Q format with the slave bands shifted by a small amount in
range and azimuth directions. <br>

  </li>
</ul>


<h4>Parameters Used<br>
</h4>




<ul>
  <li>Registration Window Width: Width of the sub-set of image used
for cross-correlation. <br>
  </li>
  <li>Registration Window Height: Height of the sub-set of image used
for cross-correlation. Larger window generally implies accurate
estimation of the range shift and also means larger memory and longer
processing time.</li>
  <li>Search Window Accuracy in Azimuth Direction: The search accuracy
in azimuth direction for the maximum correlation. The search window
height is 2*Acc.</li>
  <li>Search
Window Accuracy in Range Direction: The search accuracy in range
direction for the maximum correlation. The search window width is
2*Acc. .</li>
  <li>Window Oversampling Factor: The oversampling factor for the
search window. The larger the factor, the better the achievable
accuracy, and the larger the computation cost.<br>
  </li>
  <li>Cross-Correlation Threshold: Threshold
for normalized cross-correlation value. If the cross-correlation value
is greater than the threshold, then the estimated range offset is
considered valid, otherwise invalid.</li>
  <li>Coherence Threshold for Outlier Removal: <br>
  </li>
  <li>Number of Windows Per Overlap for ESD: The number of windows for azimuth offset estimation using ESD for each overlap area.</li>
  <li>Use User supplied shifts: If the checkbox is selected, then user
supplied azimuth and range offsets will be used in shifting the image.
For azimuth offsets, user can enter the shift value to be used, or check the box(es)&nbsp;to read the&nbsp;<span>ESD estimations saved in ASCII files (assumed to be located in </span><span>user's \.snap\var\log folder)</span><span>.</span> No cross-correlation or ESD will be performed to estimate the offsets.</li>
  <li>The overall azimuth shift in pixels: The user provided azimuth offset in pixels. <br>
  </li>
  <li>The overall range shift in pixels: The user provided range offset in pixels. <br>
  </li>
</ul>
