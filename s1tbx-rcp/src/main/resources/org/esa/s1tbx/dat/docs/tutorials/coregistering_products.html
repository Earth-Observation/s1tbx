<h3>Coregistering&nbsp;Products</h3>

<p>
    Image co-registration is fundamental for Interferometry SAR (InSAR)
    imaging and its applications, such as DEM map generation and analysis.
    To obtain a high quality InSAR image, the individual complex images
    need to be co-registered to sub-pixel accuracy.</p>

<p><br>The
    toolbox will accurately&nbsp;co-register one&nbsp;or more&nbsp;secondary
    images with respect to a reference image. The co-registration function is
    fully automatic, in the sense that it does not require the user to
    manually select ground control points (GCPs) for the reference and secondary
    images.</p>

<p><br>Images
    may be fully or only partly overlapping and may be from acquisitions
    taken at different times using multiple sensors or from multiple
    passages of the same satellite.</p>

<p><br>The achievable
    co-registration accuracy for images in the same acquisition geometry
    and over flat areas will be better than 0.2 pixels for two real images
    and better than 0.05 pixels for two complex images.</p>

<p><br>The image co-registration is accomplished in three major processing steps (see Figure 1) with three operators: <a
        href="../operators/CollocateOp.html">Create Stack operator</a>,&nbsp;<a href="../operators/GCPSelectionOp.html">GCP
    Selection operator</a> and&nbsp;<a href="../operators/WarpOp.html">Warp operator</a>. </p><br><img

<h4>Input Images</h4>

<p>The input images for the co-registration function can be
    complex&nbsp;or real. But all&nbsp;images must belong to the same type
    (i.e. they must all be complex or all real) and have the same
    projection system (all slant range or all ground range projected or all
    geocoded). &nbsp; If the images are not in the same projection, the
    secondary image(s) should be
    reprojected into the same projection system as that of the reference
    image.
</p><h4>Create Stack</h4>

<p>The
    Create Stack operator&nbsp;collocates the reference and secondary images.
    Basically the secondary image data is resampled into the geographical
    raster of the reference image. By doing so the reference and secondary images
    share the same geopositioning information and have the same dimension.
    For details of the Create Stack operator,&nbsp;readers are referred to <a href="../operators/CollocateOp.html">Create
        Stack operator</a>.
    For coregistration of detected products it is ok to use the resamling
    methods. For coregistration of complex products for interferometry, the
    option to not do any resampling in the CreateStack should be used.</p><h4>GCP Selection</h4>

<p>The
    GCP Selection operator then creates an alignment between&nbsp;reference
    and secondary images by matching the user
    selected reference GCPs to their corresponding secondary GCPs. There are two
    stages for the operation: coarse registration and fine registration.
    For real images co-registration, the coarse registration is applied.
    The registration&nbsp;is achieved by maximizing the
    cross-correlation between reference and secondary images on a series of
    imagettes defined across the images. For complex image co-registration,
    the additional fine registration is applied. The registration is
    achieved by maximizing the&nbsp;coherence between reference and
    secondary&nbsp;images at a series of imagettes defined across the images.&nbsp;For details of
    the&nbsp;GCP Selection operator, readers are referred to&nbsp;<a href="../operators/GCPSelectionOp.html">GCP
        Selection operator</a>.</p><h4>Warp</h4>

<p>With
    the reference-secondary GCP pairs selected, a warp function is created by the
    Warp operator, which&nbsp;maps pixels
    in the secondary image into pixels in the reference image.&nbsp;For details of
    the&nbsp;Warp operator, readers are referred to <a href="../operators/WarpOp.html">Warp operator</a>.</p><h4>
    Co-Registration from the DAT</h4>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Detailed steps of using this operator are given below:<br>
<ol>
    <li>From the SAR Tools menu, select Coregistration.</li>
    <li>Add a reference product to the ProductSet Reader.</li>
    <li>Add any secondary products to the ProductSet reader or drag and drop products from a Project.</li>
    <li>In the CreateStack tab, select one source band from the reference and one
        source band from the secondary for detected products. If you are using
        complex data products, select&nbsp;bands i and q for the reference and select
        bands i and q from the secondaries. &nbsp;For interferometric processing, select no resampling and Reference extents in
        the CreateStack.
    </li>
    <li>In the GCP Selection tab enter the number of GCPs to create.</li>
    <li>In the Warp tab select the RMS threshold and warp polynomial order.</li>
    <li>In the Target tab enter in the output product name and location.</li>
    <li>Press the Run button to begin processing.</li>
</ol>
